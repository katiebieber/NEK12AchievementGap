# Nebraska's K-12 Achievement Gap

Nebraska has good public schools. Graduation rates are consistently high. Students like going to school with average statewide attendance at 95% and low dropout rates at 1.09%. However, there are significant and persistent gaps in academic performance (proficiency) and educational attainment (graduation) among race, gender, and students from differing income levels. Below is a snapshot of Nebraska public schools' graduation rates and composite proficiency rates by race. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander have been filtered from all results as there are too few students to reveal specific numbers. Two or More Races have been filtered from proficiency of Mathematics, Reading, and Science for the same reason.

## Graduation Rate
Graduation rates in Nebraska are at an all-time high, second only to Iowa in the nation. But there are disparities among groups. Males who are economically disadvantaged are always outperformed by females in the same category for graduation rates in Nebraska. With the exception of American Indian and Alaskan Native, and the 2011-2012 school year for Asians, females also outperform males when both groups live above the poverty line. Females and males living in poverty have graduation rates that fluctuate overtime but non-poverty students, both male and female, seem to have an upward trend line.

When looking at graduation rates by males only, poverty and non-poverty students have more overlap, especially among American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, and Hispanic races. Similarly, females by non-poverty and poverty have overlap for Black or African American and Hispanic races. This would suggest that there is less of a gap among these races, especially, it would seem, among Hispanics where lines overlap several times. Alternatively, Asians have a very large gap among the same gender but differing income status, between 15 and 20 percent. Whites also have a consistent gap, whether male or female, but to a lesser degree at 5-10 percent.

## Mathematics Proficiency
When comparing poverty with non-poverty students, females and males perform very similarly to one another. It is worth noting that, with the exception of non-poverty female and male American Indian or Alaska Natives, all races are on a steady uphill trend. One would expect that any group not experiencing poverty would be on an uphill climb to some degree, but they are, in fact, going the opposite direction. Conversely, American Indian or Alaska Natives in poverty are going in a positive direction.

Comparing males, poverty versus non-poverty and females, poverty versus non-poverty, there is a large gap that mirrors its counterpart almost exactly over time, save for American Indian or Alaska Native. Asians outperform every group with Whites following in second. American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American perform at the lower end.

## Reading Proficiency
Similar to Mathematics, males poverty versus non-poverty and females poverty versus non-poverty, shows a large gap that mirrors its counterpart almost exactly over time but for American Indian or Alaska Native. The comparison of poverty to non-poverty students yields similar results to Mathematics with female and male students except that the gap has widened among gender. The mirrored upward trend line remains the same except for non-poverty American Indian or Alaska Natives.

## Science Proficiency 
The comparison here of poverty to non-poverty students has a closer relationship to Mathematics in that the mirrored gap of males and females is fairly tight and sometimes intertwining. Students in poverty in all races but White perform similarly with White student in poverty outperforming all others. However, Asians not in poverty outperform all other non-poverty groups.

Again, as with Reading, males poverty versus non-poverty and females poverty versus non-poverty, shows a large gap for all races. Most races have a gap of 20 percent for both genders between poverty and non-poverty. Both Asian females and males show a 40 percent gap between income status.

## Looking Forward: Performance and Attainment
For the state of Nebraska to make systematic and systemic improvements in graduation rates and proficiency in Mathematics, Reading, and Science, school administrators will need to target all minority groups in poverty as economic conditions are the key factor success or failure on performance on state tests and high school degree attainment. Those in poverty seem to have a less pronounced difference for graduation than for proficiency in Mathematics, Reading, and Science. This would lead one to believe that graduation and proficiency are not tied together and that someone who is not proficient in the three core areas can still graduate. This deserves more research and thought. A targeted approach for males in all minority groups would certainly help scores and attainment but not to the degree of helping those in poverty for both genders. Interventions and support in these groups will reduce the achievement gap and increase graduation rates and proficiency overall. Focused attention should be paid to American Indian and Alaska Natives as the data shows their needs are different from other groups (those in poverty are increasing in Mathematics proficiency while those above the poverty line are declining).

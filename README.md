# Nebraska's K-12 Achievement Gap

Nebraska has good public schools. Graduation rates are consistently high. Students like going to school with average statewide attendance at 95% and low dropout rates (1.09%). However, there are significant and persistent gaps in academic performance (proficiency) and educational attainment (graduation) among race, gender, and students from differing income levels. Below is a snapshot of Nebraska public schools' graduation rates and composite proficiency rates by race. Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander have been filtered from all results as there are too few students to reveal specific numbers. Two or More Races have been filtered from proficiency of Mathematics, Reading, and Science for the same reason.

## Graduation Rate
As stated, graduation rates are high, second only to Iowa in the nation. But there are disparities among groups. Females who are economically disadvantaged always outperform males in the same category for graduation rates in Nebraska. With the exception of American Indian and Alaskan Native and the 2011-2012 year for Asians, females also outperform males if they live above the poverty line. Females and males living in poverty have graduation rates that fluctuate overtime. However, non-poverty students, both male and female, seem to have an upward trend line.

When looking at graduation rates by males only, poverty and non-poverty students have more overlap, especially among American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, and Hispanic. Similarly, females by non-poverty and poverty have overlap for Black and African American and Hispanic races. This would suggest that there is less of gap among these races, especially, it would seem, among Hispanics. Alternatively, Asians have a very large gap, between 15 and 20 percent. Whites also have a consistent gap, whether male or female, but to a lesser degree at 5-10 percent.

## Mathematics Proficiency
When comparing poverty with non-poverty students, females and males perform very similarly to one another. It is worth noting that, with the exception of non-poverty female and male American Indian or Alaska Natives, all races are on a steady uphill trend. One would expect that any group not in poverty would be on the uphill climb but they are, I fact, going the opposite direction. Also, those in poverty in the same group are going in a positive direction.

Comparing males, poverty versus non-poverty and females, poverty versus non-poverty, there is a large gap that mirrors its counterpart almost exactly over time, save for American Indian or Alaska Native. Asians outperform every group with Whites following in second. American Indian or Alaska Native and Black or African American perform at the lower end.

## Reading Proficiency
The comparison of poverty to non-poverty students yields similar results to Mathematics with female and male students except that the gap has widened among gender. The upward mirrored trend line remains the same except for non-poverty American Indian or Alaska Natives.

Similar to Mathematics, males poverty versus non-poverty and females poverty versus non-poverty, shows a large gap that mirrors its counterpart almost exactly over time but for American Indian or Alaska Native. The very large gap among Asians, poverty versus non-poverty seems to show the difference in Asian classes in Nebraska.

## Science Proficiency 
The comparison here of poverty to non-poverty students has a closer relationship to Mathematics in that the mirrored gap of males and females is fairly tight and sometimes intertwining. Students in poverty in all races but White perform similarly with White student in poverty outperforming all others. However, Asians not in poverty outperform all other non-poverty groups.

Again, males poverty versus non-poverty and females poverty versus non-poverty, shows a large gap for all races. Most races have a gap of 20 percent for both genders between poverty and non-poverty. Both Asian females and males show a 40 percent gap between income status.

If the state of Nebraska would like to make systematic and systemic improvements in graduation rates and proficiency in Mathematics, Reading, and Science, we need to target all minority groups in poverty and minority males. Interventions in these groups will reduce the achievement gap and increase graduation rates and proficiency overall.
